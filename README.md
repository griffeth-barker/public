# Purpose
This is my public-facing Git repository. The purpose of this repo is to be able to post and store sanitized copies of miscellaneous scripts that I have authored throughout the course of my IT career. Commits to this repository will be sporadic as I will only sanitize these scripts for commits in my free time, which is sparse. It is likely that some of the content you may find here will not be the most efficient or optimal way to accomplish something, as this collection of scripts is reflective of a journey through time. I will come back through and improve various scripts as I go, but some content may not be updated frequently. 

This repository is *not* intended to be a reliable source of ready-built solutions for your production environment. Always understand exactly what a command or script does before you run it!

# Audience
The primary audience is--well--me. However, I have opted to make this particular repository public-facing so that others who may have similar needs may find inspiration or ideas from the scripts that I've come up with. If that means that you see something here and think "oh I could do it better this way", then that is perfect!

# About the Author
I am an IT systems engineer with experience spanning hospitality, gaming, and educational technology space. I began learning PowerShell in 2018 and have been increasingly leveraging it with every passing year. Typically working on small IT teams, automating tasks is always of interest. I've typically worked in generalist roles, dabbling in PS and automation where I have free time--which is seldom. In more recent years, my use and ability with PowerShell has increased drastically, though my time spent publishing things here has reduced.
